Software Designs Patterns. Based on book **Design Patterns. Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software** by 
*Erich Gamma*, *Richard Helm*, *Ralph Johnson* and *John Vlissides*.  
  
- **Creational patterns**:
  - Singleton:  
    - Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
    
  - Factory Method:
    - Define an interface for creating an object,but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method 
    lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
    
  - Prototype:
    - Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this 
    prototype.
    
  - Builder:
    - Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can 
    create different representations.
